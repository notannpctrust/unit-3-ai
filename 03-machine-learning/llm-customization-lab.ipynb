    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:** *So a Large Language model is a type of AI that is trained using the massive amounts of text data to understand how to write text like a human*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:** *To \"prompt an AI,it essentially means to give a criteria to fill out when asking it a question,For example,if I were to ask an AI to \"Give me a short and simple explanation of what the coding Language Python is.\"The AI would then follow that prompt.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:** *In prompt engineering,some techniques involved would be directly modifying the prompts you use.Another would be Zero-Shot programming,which essentially means tasking the AI to give you an answer to your prompt with no more or no less than wht you ask for.*\n",

    "##### Question 03\n",
